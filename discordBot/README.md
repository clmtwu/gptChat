This subfolder contains scripts to bridge my scripts to a discord bot. You'll need the OpenAI api key (duh), but now also the discord bot token. The bot needs all privileges (presence intent, content intent, etc) set on the developer page. Refer to any errors you get when running the script if you encouter them.

You'll also need to run ```pip3 install discord```.
